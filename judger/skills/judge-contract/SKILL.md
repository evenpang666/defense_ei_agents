# Judge Contract

Return exactly this JSON object:

```
{"task_result": "SUCCESS" | "FAIL", "analysis": "<concise reason; empty string allowed if SUCCESS>"}
```

Rules:
- Judge one atomic task at a time.
- When phase manifests are provided, judge phases in order using only the current
  phase's attached front/wrist RGB images. Stop at the first failed phase and
  report that phase's concrete failure and correction target.
- For a non-final phase, `SUCCESS` means the current phase goal appears achieved
  and validation may continue. For the final phase, `SUCCESS` means the full
  atomic task's target state and done criteria are satisfied.
- When no phase manifest is provided, compare the final front/wrist RGB images
  against the atomic task's target state and done criteria.
- Treat execution errors as failure unless the visual state clearly satisfies the
  atomic task anyway.
- For failure, name the concrete problem: wrong object, missed target, no visible
  motion, incomplete press/open/close/pour, object dropped, gripper still holding,
  unsafe collision, or occlusion.
- Do not output markdown or prose outside the JSON object.
